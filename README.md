# DeepClean: End-to-End Prompt-Guided Object Removal and Inpainting

DeepClean is a modular image editing system that supports prompt-driven object removal and replacement using an end-to-end pipeline. It also includes Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) fine-tuning components to improve the rendering of text within inpainted regions.

---

## üöÄ Setup

Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r deepclean_requirements.txt
2. Install editable package for LoRA fine-tuning:
   ```bash
   cd deepclean/lora
   pip install -e .
3. Install editable package for language-based segmentation:
   ```bash
   cd ../language-segment-anything
   pip install -e .

## üñºÔ∏è Run
To run the end-to-end pipeline:
  ```bash
  python main.py \
    --src_image_path path/to/source_image.jpg \
    --remove_object "prompt specifying object to remove" \
    --inpainting_prompt "prompt specifying object to add" \
    --output_dir path/to/output/

```
Replace the arguments with your specific inputs. The output image will contain the object removed and inpainted with the desired content.
If you want to run inference with our finetuned SDXL checkpoint, then please put '<s1>' token in inpainting_prompt such as 'write <s1> POLICE in sign'.

Example:
  ```bash
  python main.py \
  --src_image_path images/input.jpg \
  --remove_object "remove the car" \
  --inpainting_prompt "add a school bus" \
  --output_dir results/
```
